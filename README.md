# Car MSRP Prediction
This repository contains code and data for predicting the manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) of cars based on various features of the cars.

*Data*

The data used in this project is a modified version of the Car Evaluation Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The modified data set is included in the data directory.

*Code*

The code for training and evaluating machine learning models to predict car MSRP is included in the Car_MSRP_Prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

*Dependencies*

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn

*Usage*

To run the Jupyter Notebook, first install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Then, start Jupyter Notebook and open the Car_MSRP_Prediction.ipynb file:
